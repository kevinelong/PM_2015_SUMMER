        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>I'm a languages nerd - the kind of person who thinks studying Ancient Greek is super fun - and recently I branched out into computer languages as well.</p>
        <p>I've studied Java at college, Ruby on my own, and Python through PDX Code Guild. I love each one in its own special way, and I want to become
            more and more of a polyglot. I'm currently looking for developer opportunities.</p>
        <p>Bonus facts:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>On the human languages side, apart from Ancient Greek, I've studied Modern Greek, Spanish, German, and Latin.</li><br>
            <li>Other hobbies include baking, board games, and hanging out with my amazing three-legged cat, Foo.</li>
