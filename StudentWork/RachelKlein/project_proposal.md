# Capstone Project Proposal: WoohooList

WoohooList is a social media app where users create communities that help them achieve their goals. Users create profiles in which they choose a large goal (such as running a marathon) and break it down into smaller steps, then "friend" others who have goals in the same broad category. They are rewarded both for accomplishing their goals and for encouraging others through a point system.

## Components

## Login and new user signup

Registered users can sign in from the WoohooList homepage. They will be able to see their own profile page as well as a feed of their friends' accomplishments. Logged in users will also see their points and their "next step" wherever they are on the page.

## Goal setting page/user profile

On the goal setting page/profile, there is a form where users set goals. Users designate a specific, achievable large goal (e.g. "Run my first 5K") and a timeline (e.g. "In 3 months"). They then break the goal into smaller steps that will be repeated daily or several times a week (e.g. "Train 3 times a week"). The finished page will have the large goal at the top as well as an overview of their plan and how much of it they've accomplished (measured by the point system).

## Friending other users and accomplishments feed

Each goal will have a category (fitness, finance, etc.) and each profile page will automatically display links to the profiles of others with similar goals. Then they can click on an icon on their profile to "friend" them and see their accomplishments listed on a feed. Each user will see their feed when they log in.

## Comments and point system

When users click on a friend's accomplishment, they will be taken to a detail page with a comment form. They will also be able to see others' comments. Leaving a comment will increment the count of their total points on their user profile. 

## Timeline

1. Map out models and make migrations for User, Goal, Step, Comment
2. Make views and templates (including base template with CSS themes) for homepage, user profile, feed, accomplishment detail page
3. Make authentication form for login page
4. Create view, template, and form for goal setting page
5. Devise search function to query for users with similar goals and adjust template of feed page to display links to their profiles
6. Create form to enter a comment on an accomplishment on accomplishment page
7. Devise point system and make sure points are incrementing correctly
8. Add JavaScript (such as animations or alerts congratulating you when you make an accomplishment) and error pages

## Ideas for Later

* Users can add multiple big goals and designate one as primary goal
* More nuanced searching for other users' goals
* Users can make goals visible only to friends
* Users can block specific other users and report inappropriate content
