# Capstone Project

I plan to make a working website/blog for my friends artwork. Allowing him the ability to upload images and make comments on them as you’d do with any common blog.

My goal is to create something extremely straight forward and user friendly, as he is not very good with computers but wants to showcase his art.

I chose to do something that was a bit less complicated from other concepts to insure that I’d be able to accomplish what I want to accomplish. My primary goal is to garner a more solid understanding of Django; secondary is to give my friend website that he’ll (hopefully) use.

## Project Description

A dynamic blog post styled web portfolio to showcase artwork.
User will be able to easily make new postings; adding images and details about the artwork.

## Components

The primary component will be an upload blog form with very easy to understand functionality.

### Portfolio page

This page will show all blog posts represented as a grid of artwork.

### Single piece page

This page will show an art piece with: Piece title, Date created, Time Spent to create, Equipment used to create: pens, rulers, paper, airbrush, etc..

### About Page

This page will give information about the artist and will be editable by the artist.

## ￼Timeline

  1. Map out all models and create all migrations ­ this shouldn’t take too long, but I’m going to give myself a day to get it together.
  2. Create the pages for About, Portfolio Page and Single Piece Page ­ again, this shouldn’t take too long but because each page has different functionality I’m going to look at 2­3 days to make them all work correctly.
  3. Getting the 404 and 500 error pages in place ­ probably less than a day
  4. CSS and JS ­ again, I’ll be styling 3 different pages. This might take me a couple hours
or it could take me the better part of a day. Depends on how specific I choose get.

## Ideas for Later

  + Ability to easily share on social media: Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc...
  + Add the ability to purchase prints via an online store
