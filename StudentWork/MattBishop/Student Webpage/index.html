    <h3>About</h3>
    <p>Hi, I'm Matt Bishop. This is my webpage where I share all of my favorite work, from web and software development to video art production. Check out the links below to view examples of my work! I hope to expand this webpage with portfolio pieces soon.</p>
    <p>I currently attend <a href="https://pdxcodeguild.com/">PDX Code Guild</a>, a programming and web development boot camp in Portland, OR. </p>

<h4>Skills I'm developing in coding boot camp:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Python</li>
      <li>HTML, CSS, Javascript</li>
      <li>Django</li>
      <li>SQL</li>
    </ul>
  <h4>Soft skills I have developed through education / work:</h4>
  <p>I have learned many invaluable skills over the course of my college and professional career. With over a decade and a half of experience in the service industry, I have honed numerous interpersonal skills rather adeptly. </p>
<ul>
  <li>Communication - I am a proficient communicator. Whether I am managing staff or working within a group on a project or goal, I am able to assess need, express myself and listen to others. </li>
  <li>Teamwork - I have never worked in an environment where I wasn't part of a team. It is only through teamwork that expectations are established and goals met. I thrive in this environment!</li>
  <li>Adaptability - I am accustomed to high-stress situations that require deadlines to be met or time-sensitive actions to occur. But I also appreciate the value of planning and organizing and will afford as much time as needed to get the job done right.</li>
  <li>Problem Solving - As a programmer I am expected to, ultimately, solve problems and find solutions with code. However, I am well-versed in conflict resolution, maintaining good working relationships and offering solutions to problems people face in a work environment.</li>
  <li>Leadership - Through careful observation, empathy, warmth and open-mindedness, I often inspire others to do their best in a team-oriented environment!</li>
</ul>
  <p>I am more than happy to forward a resume if you are interested in learning more!</p>
