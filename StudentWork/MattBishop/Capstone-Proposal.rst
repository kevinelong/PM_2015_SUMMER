Capstone Project - A complete, functioning website for grocery store
====================================================================


A Functional Website
====================
My project is to finish the website I created with my Javascript project for the fictional Skylark Grocery. Upon completion the site will be fully functional, integrating common characteristics of deployed webpages. The completed project will also be a broad display of overall, full stack competency.


To Be Created:
==============

The Blog Page -
---------------

The administrator can view and create new blogs for the store, as well as view and approve comments from guests. Sample blogs will be created to demonstrate functionality on the front end. This is a common implementation of Django which is useful in work environments.

Polls -
-------

Built in the blogs will be online polls for guests, such as a potential, new store location or store related sales. I intend to create at least two of these within separate blog posts. Again, this is a common way Django sends information to the database for later use. Polls add another level of interactivity for users and provides administrators useful information about guests' opinions.

Contact Form -
--------------

A simple form that stores guest information along with a comment a guest wishes to leave for the store. An option will also be provided to sign up for a mailing list, which will be handled as a separate model. Another useful and easily implemented task for Django.


Timeline:
=========

1. Allow two days for the completion of Javascript elements not previously finished, primarily related to the Shopping page. Make Shopping page more prevalent on Home page.

2. Create all models for project; migrate.

3. Create Blog page, manage all urls and views.

4. Create and run test to ensure everything works!

5. Polish: Take a closer look at design, incorporate new JQuery magic for navigation, create error pages.

Ideas for Later:
================

    - A login page would be awesome, particularly for the Shopping section (a saved grocery cart, perhaps?)
    - Implementing Bootstrap *would* ensure the entire site is responsive (instead of manually adding break points to the CSS). Definitely something to attempt if I have time.
    - More instances of Javascript in the project! I need the practice and I'd enjoy more interactivity/magic!
