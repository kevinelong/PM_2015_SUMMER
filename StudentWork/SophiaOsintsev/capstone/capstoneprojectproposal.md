# Capstone Project Proposal: Recipe Manager App 
============================

## Project Description
============================
This will be a recipe manager website where user can login to view all her saved recipes and shopping cart. From her account, user will be able to add, edit, and delete recipes and also upload photos of the recipes.

## Components
============================
### Login and new user sign up

From the Home page user can click either Login or Sign up. Once logged in, user will be able to see his account dashboard where he can access details on his account. This includes all the recipes they have added and the shopping cart. 

To sign up, user will need to fill out a registration form.

### User Account Dashboard

Here user will be able to view, add, edit and delete her recipes. Each recipe will also have an option for an image upload. There will also be a link to shopping tab/link.

### Shopping Cart

Once user opens the shopping cart tab, if she has already entered in items, she will see them in her list. She will be able to add and remove items from her list. 

## Timeline
============================
1. Map out models and make migrations.
2. Create views and templates for home page, user dashboard, shopping list, and login and registration forms.
3. Create authentication form for login page and registration.
4. Create 404 and 500 error pages. Maybe add CSS and Javascript to make them look nice.

## Ideas for Later
============================
* Create a built in timer
* Have a weekly planner
* Be able to push items from the recipe into the shopping list
