This is a simple doc I'm making to keep track of what I know about Python
I will probably include examples

control-s saves files in Pycharm
control + shift + f10 runs a file in Pycharm

You print strings or numbers easy
you can print a integer + a string if you put a comma in between.
You can do simple math using the print function
/ rounds down
% divides and shows remainder
The = (single-equal) assigns the value on the right to a variable on the left.
The == (double-equal) tests if two things have the same value
You should add space around operators

variables
you can use a comma to insert a variable
you can also use % to insert a variable
%() is how you insert multiple variables
you can do math inside that variable ()
if you want multiple formats in your string to print multiple variables,
you need to put them inside ( )
What's the point of %s and %d when you can just use %r?
The %r is best for debugging
%d is for a number
%s is for string
Use the %r for debugging, since it displays the "raw" data of the variable, but the others are used for displaying to users
I'm at chapter 8 now
you can set a variable and put multiple things into it using print
\t for tab
\n for newline
in exercise 10 they declare a variable and use it to print a tabbed list. It's kinda cool
\\ is a backslash
\' is a single quote
\" is a double quote
you take in input using raw data
you can change a raw input string to a variable by using x = int(raw_input())
I'm on ex 12 now
you don't need to type print when you are doing raw input

I got slowed down learning about pydoc
argv allows you to input multiple variables but you have to have "from sys import argv" at the top of the page to use it
to use argv you need to enter your variables when you run the program
as in python ex13.py first 2nd 3rd
you can print the filename of the current file by using "print __file__" without the quotes
argv is a feature, features are known as modules in Python. There are many modules available

I finished at chapter 13
