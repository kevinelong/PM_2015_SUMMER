This is a simple doc I'm making to keep track of what I know about Python
I will probably include examples

control-s saves files in Pycharm
control + shift + f10 runs a file in Pycharm
control + z + enter in powershell to quit python
you run a python file in pewershell by being in the correct folder and entering in "python plus the file name" without the quotes or plus


You print strings or numbers easy
you can print a integer + a string if you put a comma in between.
You can do simple math using the print function
/ rounds down
% divides and shows remainder
The = (single-equal) assigns the value on the right to a variable on the left.
The == (double-equal) tests if two things have the same value
You should add space around operators

variables
you can use a comma to insert a variable
you can also use % to insert a variable
%() is how you insert multiple variables
you can do math inside that variable ()
if you want multiple formats in your string to print multiple variables,
you need to put them inside ( )
What's the point of %s and %d when you can just use %r?
The %r is best for debugging
%d is for a number
%s is for string
Use the %r for debugging, since it displays the "raw" data of the variable, but the others are used for displaying to users
I'm at chapter 8 now
you can set a variable and put multiple things into it using print
\t for tab
\n for newline
in exercise 10 they declare a variable and use it to print a tabbed list. It's kinda cool
\\ is a backslash
\' is a single quote
\" is a double quote
you take in input using raw data
you can change a raw input string to a variable by using x = int(raw_input())
I'm on ex 12 now
you don't need to type print when you are doing raw input

I got slowed down learning about pydoc
argv allows you to input multiple variables but you have to have "from sys import argv" at the top of the page to use it
to use argv you need to enter your variables when you run the program
as in python ex13.py first 2nd 3rd
you can print the filename of the current file by using "print __file__" without the quotes
argv is a feature, features are known as modules in Python. There are many modules available

I finished at chapter 13

anytime you use argv you need to put in an entry when you run the file or else there will be an error

close -- Closes the file. Like File->Save.. in your editor.
read -- Reads the contents of the file. You can assign the result to a variable.
readline -- Reads just one line of a text file.
truncate -- Empties the file. Watch out if you care about the file.
write('stuff') -- Writes "stuff" to the file.

I finished at chapter 16-took me an hour to get through 3 chapters


If you get a syntax error try
1) Copy your code and paste it in Notepad++

2) Select Encoding -> Encode in UTF-8

3) Select View -> Show Symbol -> Show All Characters


7-3-15 Starting back at chapter 16
4:30

chapter 16, 17 were about opening files and inputting information into them.
on to Chapter 18
functions
functions do 3 things
They name pieces of code the way variables name strings and numbers.
They take arguments the way your scripts take argv.
Using 1 and 2 they let you make your own "mini-scripts" or "tiny commands."

You can create a function by using the word def

continued to work through chapter 20
ended at 8
3-1/2 hours to do 5 chapters and get chicken dinner, not bad

start at 21 tomorrow
I had to git commit and git push to get my git to merge tonight.
