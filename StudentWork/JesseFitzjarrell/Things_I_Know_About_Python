This is a simple doc I'm making to keep track of what I know about Python
I will probably include examples

control-s saves files in Pycharm
control + shift + f10 runs a file in Pycharm

You print strings or numbers easy
you can print a integer + a string if you put a comma in between.
You can do simple math using the print function
/ rounds down
% divides and shows remainder
The = (single-equal) assigns the value on the right to a variable on the left.
The == (double-equal) tests if two things have the same value
You should add space around operators

variables
you can use a comma to insert a variable
you can also use % to insert a variable
%() is how you insert multiple variables
you can do math inside that variable ()
if you want multiple formats in your string to print multiple variables,
  you need to put them inside ( )
