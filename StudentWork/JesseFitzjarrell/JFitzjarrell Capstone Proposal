Capstone Proposal
8-17-15

I feel like I have really struggled in this class and my main focus in my capstone is to pick something easy that I can complete.
It seems like all the examples I see of Django are weblogs so that’s what I think I should do.
A weblog with dropdown links and a couple pages.

My main plan is to follow the Django documentation and create that site while hopefully adding a few bells and whistles to make it interesting.
I'm not sure what kind of blog, maybe restaurant reviews, or recipes, or hiking trail reports. Something like that.
I hope to include HTML, javaScript, Django and CSS elements.
If I complete this project before the project is due I will start on another more ambitious project.

What do you think of my simple proposal?
I feel like part of being a developer is being able to read and follow documentation so this would be a good challenge.
I’d also really like to get this done so I can work on that wordpress hot sauce site for my friend.
I think they will both be good projects for a final portfolio for me to shop around. But I am really curious to hear your opinion.
honestly I think this will be a challenge, just completing this project. I'm really behind in this class.
