#Ideas for Later: 
 
Part 2: The Graffiti Wall(s)
4 addition survey quetions ask people to define or say what something means to them. 
The answer would then be used for this:

A large wall picture with sort of random words over it.
Mouse over a word and the entire statement from a person will open in a pop up window with the entire statement.
Write some sort of program that randomly picks the words
  -Not common words like the, or a etc. 
Write some sort of a progam that makes the words all graffiti style, not sure if a font or something.
Have the words be random font sized and randomly placed, maybe with some angles and things.
