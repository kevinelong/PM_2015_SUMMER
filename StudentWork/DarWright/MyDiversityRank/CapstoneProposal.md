# Project Description 
My project is a way to show how diverse the people around you are, in their jobs, interests and basic human stats.  
 
#Components 
 
##User Interface 
The user interface will include a create user/login option. 
 
##Data presentation 
Once logged in, the user can push a variety of buttons to generate a pie chart of the different diversity areas.  
 
##Data entry 
A page that allows the logged in user to enter the data from their circles, and save it to the database.

#Ideas for Later: 
 
Part 2: The Graffiti Wall(s)
4 addition survey quetions ask people to define or say what something means to them. 
The answer would then be used for this:

A large wall picture with sort of random words over it.
Mouse over a word and the entire statement from a person will open in a pop up window with the entire statement.
Write some sort of program that randomly picks the words
  -Not common words like the, or a etc. 
Write some sort of a progam that makes the words all graffiti style, not sure if a font or something.
Have the words be random font sized and randomly placed, maybe with some angles and things.
