#Ideas for Later: 
 
User can create a survey form, with diversity options, max of ten per question (as applicable) and email it out with a unique link the recipient can click, get to a special data entry form page, fill out the form and submit their results, all associated with the user login that sent the email link. 
 
Add an OVERALL pie chart that compares each users diversity high and low stats with other users.
