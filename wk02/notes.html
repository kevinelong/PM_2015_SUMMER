    RECOMMENDED GIT PROCESS:

        0.  Get Coffee.

        1.  Sat down? -> "git pull"

        2.  Write some code.

        3.  Wrote some code? -> "git commit -m 'cool beans'"
            Commit micro-tasks constantly!

        4a. If you work on your own Branch or Fork as god intended:

            Lunch? -> "git push" - Every time you stand up and walk away.

        4b. If you are a heathen and do not work on your own Branch or Fork:

            Code works and tests pass? -> "git push" - Every time you stand up and walk away.

        5.  Repeat
