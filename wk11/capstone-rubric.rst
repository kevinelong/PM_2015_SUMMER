Final Capstone Rubric
=====================

The final capstone project is due no later than Tuesday October 6, 2015 at
11:59pm. The project will be considered complete when an email sent to
reina@pdxcodeguild.com with a link to the completed project on GitHub.

It is expected that this project will be the work of the student alone. While
it is important to use the internet for guidance, the purpose of this project
is to demonstrate all that was learned during the bootcamp course. Students may
work together but each must submit their own distinct project.

Students must receive at least 80 points of 100 to pass. The available points
are described below.


Programming Skills
------------------
_Django_ 20pts: Demonstrate ability to create a web application using the Django
framework

_JavaScript_ 10pts: Make the page dynamic by writing custom JavaScript. Copying from
the internet is not enough. Using Bootstrap's built in JavaScript libraries is
not enough. Consider the following ideas:
#.  List items that change color on hover
#.  Drop down menus
#.  JQuery animations when a form is submitted

_CSS_ 10pts: Include quality CSS to ensure the website has a professional look and
feel.

_HTML_ 5pts and _python_ 20pts: It is assumed that as part of using Django you will be
able to demonstrate competence in these.

_Unittests_ 5pts: Include unittests as part of your code base. At least one file
with at least 5 tests is required. All tests must pass.

_Git_ 10pts: The project is tracked in GitHub in a separate repository. Commits are
created at reasonable intervals to demonstrate progress. Consider creating at
least one commit per class day.


Soft Skills
-----------
_Completeness_ 10pts: The project must be complete. All forms completed. All links
work.

_Project Proposal_ 10pts: The proposal doc was turned in on time and met the
standards of a professional design document. The project follows this design
and does not stray from it without a change to the proposal doc.
